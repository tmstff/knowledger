## Decision

* In the context of the knowledger project,
* facing the need to use a programming language to write an API backend,
* we decided for [GoLang](https://go.dev/)
* and against a lot of other popular languages like Java, Kotlin, Python, Type Script, Rust etc.,
* to achieve low application startup times, a low memory footprint, small deliverables, absence of auto magic, easily
understandable code and - last but not least - a practice ground for Tim to stay up to date with developing GoLang
applications,
* accepting that you sometimes have to write more code and that the eco system (libraries, frameworks & tools) is less
developed compared to many other languages.
